#### Convenient Solana Smart Contracts via Anchor
This repo is a tiny example of an onchain program, 
that can store and load data from solana accounts.

#### How to run?
1. Install Solana CLI, Rust, NodeJS (+ ts-node)
2. Run `ts-node app/main.ts` 

You might need to run `npm install` (dependency installation) and `solana-test-validator` (local Solana ledger) beforehand.
